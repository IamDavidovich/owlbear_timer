# Timer
A countdown timer for Owlbear Rodeo, to keep your turns ticking.

## TODO
- Move the activity/inactivity of controller buttons to read directly from the timer in order to handle multiple DMs
- Set the badge background (or something else) to change as timeouts occur. (API doesn't seem to work?)
- Migrate all my ancient react code to be more modern
- Get it up on GH + pages
- A proper readme.
